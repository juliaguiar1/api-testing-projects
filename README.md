# API Testing Projects Repository

This repository is designed to host multiple API testing projects, each with its own Postman collection and environment for testing different APIs. Currently, it contains the **Hunter API - Resources** project, and it will be expanded with additional API testing projects in the future.

## Current Project: Hunter API - Postman Collection

This project includes a Postman collection for testing the **Hunter API**. The collection includes requests for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting leads and lead lists.

### Project Structure

- **Postman/collections**: Contains the exported Postman collection file (`Hunter_API_Resources.json`) for testing the Hunter API.
- **Postman/environments**: Contains the environment file (`environment_variables.json`) with all environment variables, including the API key (masked).
- **Reports**: Contains the test reports generated by Newman.
- **Newman**: Scripts for running Postman collections using the Newman CLI.

### Future Projects

In addition to the **Hunter API** project, this repository is intended to include multiple API testing projects. Each project will have its own Postman collection and environment, organized in a similar manner.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Import Postman Collection

1. Open **Postman**.
2. Click on **Import**.
3. Select the file `Postman/collections/Hunter_API_Resources.json`.
4. Import the collection into Postman.

### 2. Setup Environment in Postman

1. Create or select the **Desenvolvimento** environment.
2. Add the following environment variables:
   - **Key**: `API_KEY`
   - **Value**: Your real API key from [Hunter.io](https://hunter.io)
   - **Key**: `url_base`
   - **Value**: `https://api.hunter.io/v2/`
   
   Ensure that `API_KEY` is set with your actual API key value.

### 3. Run the Collection in Postman

After importing the collection and setting the environment variables, you can start running the requests directly in Postman. Simply select the **Desenvolvimento** environment and start executing the requests.

### 4. Run the Collection Using Newman

1. Install **Newman** if you don't have it installed already:
   ```bash
   npm install -g newman

### 5. Run the collection using the following command:
newman run Postman/collections/Hunter_API_Resources.json -e Postman/environments/environment_variables.json
